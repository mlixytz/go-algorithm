	josephus permutation introduction:
	People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a
	specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified
	direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is
	executed. the procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with
	the next person, going in the samedirection and skipping the same number of
	people, until only one person remains, and is freed.
